DESCRIPTION

The TreeGrid displays expandable data in a grid. Individual items can be 
expanded to display nested data. Items can have customizable action buttons on 
the right. 

The TreeGrid is designed to work with large amounts of data. Data is loaded via
a dataconnector, and only the part of the data which is currently visible is
requested from the dataconnector (lazy loading). Each of the items can contain
a pointer to a new dataconnector to load a grid with data nested under this 
item.


USAGE

To use the GWT version of the TreeGrid, create a GWT project. Put a copy of the 
modules gwt-links-treegrid.jar and gwt-visualization.jar in a subfolder of your 
project (for example lib), and add both jar-modules to your project via 
"Build path", "Add external archives...". Then, add the following lines to the 
module file MyProject.gwt.xml:

    <!-- Other module inherits                                      -->
    <inherits name='com.google.gwt.visualization.Visualization'/> 
    <inherits name='com.chap.links.TreeGrid'/>

    <!-- External stylesheets                                       -->
    <!-- Include at least one stylesheet, else the stylesheets in   -->
    <!-- external modules like Timeline.jar are not loaded          -->
    <stylesheet src=""></stylesheet>  

Thats all, now you can use the TreeGrid.
