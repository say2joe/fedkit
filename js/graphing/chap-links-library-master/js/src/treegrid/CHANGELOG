CHAP Links Library - TREEGRID
http://almende.github.com/chap-links-library/


2012-07-03, version 1.2.0

- implemented method linkItems. Items can be linked to each other via drag and,
  drop when this is implemented by the used DataConnector.


2012-06-15, version 1.1.1

- fixed a bug in calculating the height of the TreeGrid. The bug occurred
  when option items.defaultHeight < items.minHeight, and when initially giving
  a totalItems count larger then the actually available items.

- Documentation has a new layout
- Source code cleaned up


2012-05-02, version 1.0
