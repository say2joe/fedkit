DESCRIPTION

The TreeGrid displays expandable data in a grid. Individual items can be 
expanded to display nested data. Items can have customizable action buttons on 
the right. 

The TreeGrid is designed to work with large amounts of data. Data is loaded via
a dataconnector, and only the part of the data which is currently visible is
requested from the dataconnector (lazy loading). Each of the items can contain
a pointer to a new dataconnector to load a grid with data nested under this 
item.


USAGE

The TreeGrid is a standalone Javascript library. To include it on an HTML page,
add the following links in the header of your page

    <script type="text/javascript" src="treegrid/treegrid.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="treegrid/treegrid.css">

The class name of the TreeGrid is links.TreeGrid

    var treegrid = new links.TreeGrid(container, options);

After being loaded, the treegrid can be drawn via the function draw(), providing 
data.

    treegrid.draw(data);

where data is a JSON array.
