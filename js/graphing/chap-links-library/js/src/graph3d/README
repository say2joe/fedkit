DESCRIPTION

Graph3d is an interactive visualization chart to draw data in a three 
dimensional graph. You can freely move and zoom in the graph by dragging and 
scrolling in the window. Graph3d also supports animation of a graph.

The graph works smooth on any modern browser for data up to 10.000 points.

The Graph is developed as a Google Visualization Chart in javascript. There is 
a GWT wrapper available to use the Graph in GWT (Google Web Toolkit). 
It runs on all modern browsers without additional requirements. Graph3d is 
tested on Firefox 3.6+, Safari 5.0+, Chrome 6.0+, Opera 10.6+, 
Internet Explorer 9+.

To get started with Graph3d, download graph3d.zip, and unzip the contents in 
a subfolder graph3d on your site. Examples can be found in the examples 
directory. The possiblities of Graph3d can be tested on the playground.


USAGE

Graph3d is no built-in visualization of Google. To load Graph3d, download the 
file graph3d.zip, and unzip it in your html page such that the files are 
located in a subfolder graph3d. Include the google API and the following files 
in the head of your html code:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="graph/graph3d.js"></script>
    
The google visualization needs to be loaded in order to use DataTable.

    google.load("visualization", "1");
    google.setOnLoadCallback(drawVisualization);
    function drawVisualization() {
      // load data and create the graph here
    }
    
The class name of the Graph3d is links.Graph3d

    var graph = new links.Graph3d(container);

After being loaded, the graph can be drawn via the function draw(), provided 
with data and options.

    graph.draw(data, options);

where data is a DataTable, and options is a name-value map in the JSON format.
