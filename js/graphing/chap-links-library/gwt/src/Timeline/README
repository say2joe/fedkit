DESCRIPTION

The Timeline is an interactive visualization chart to visualize events in time. 
The events can take place on a single date, or have a start and end date 
(a range). You can freely move and zoom in the timeline by dragging and 
scrolling in the Timeline. Events can be created, edited, and deleted in the 
timeline. The time scale on the axis is adjusted automatically, and supports 
scales ranging from milliseconds to years.

When the timeline is defined as editable, events can be moved to another time 
by dragging them. By double clicking, the contents of an event can be changed. 
An event can be deleted by clicking the delete button on the upper right. A new 
event can be added in different ways: by double clicking in the timeline, or by 
keeping the Ctrl key down and clicking or dragging in the timeline, or by 
clicking the add button in the upper left of the timeline, and then clicking or 
dragging at the right location in the timeline.

The Timeline is developed as a Google Visualization Chart in javascript. It 
runs in every browser without additional requirements. There is a GWT wrapper 
available to use the Timeline in GWT (Google Web Toolkit), you can find relevant 
documentation here.

The Timeline is designed to display up to 100 events smoothly on any modern 
browser.


USAGE

To use the GWT version of the Timeline, create a GWT project. Put a copy of the 
modules gwt-links-timeline.jar and gwt-visualization.jar in a subfolder of your 
project (for example lib), and add both jar-modules to your project via 
"Build path", "Add external archives...". Then, add the following lines to the 
module file MyProject.gwt.xml:

    <!-- Other module inherits                                      -->
    <inherits name='com.google.gwt.visualization.Visualization'/> 
    <inherits name='com.chap.links.Timeline'/>

    <!-- External stylesheets                                       -->
    <!-- Include at least one stylesheet, else the stylesheets in   -->
    <!-- external modules like Timeline.jar are not loaded          -->
    <stylesheet src=""></stylesheet>  

Thats all, now you can use the Timeline.
