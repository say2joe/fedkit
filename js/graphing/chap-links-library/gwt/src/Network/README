DESCRIPTION

Links Network is an interactive chart to visualize networks.
It allows creating nodes, links between the nodes, and interactive packages
moving between nodes. 
The visualization supports custom styles, colors, sizes, images, and more. 

The network visualization works smooth on any modern browser for up to a 
few hundred nodes and connections.

Network is developed as a Google Visualization Chart in javascript. 
There is a GWT wrapper available to use the Network in GWT (Google Web Toolkit).

It runs on all modern browsers without additional requirements. 
Network is tested on Firefox 3.6+, Safari 5.0+, Chrome 6.0+, Opera 10.6+, 
Internet Explorer 9+.


USAGE

To use the GWT version of the Network, create a GWT project. Put a copy of the 
modules gwt-links-network.jar and gwt-visualization.jar in a subfolder of your 
project (for example lib), and add both jar-modules to your project via 
"Build path", "Configure Build Path...", "Add JARs...". Then, add the following 
lines to the module file YourProject.gwt.xml:

    <!-- Other module inherits                                      -->
    <inherits name='com.google.gwt.visualization.Visualization'/> 
    <inherits name='com.chap.links.Network'/>

Thats all, now you can use the Network visualization.
