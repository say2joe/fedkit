DESCRIPTION

The Graph is an interactive visualization chart to draw (measurement) data in 
time. You can freely move and zoom in the graph by dragging and scrolling in 
the window. The time scale on the axis is adjusted automatically, and supports 
scales ranging from milliseconds to years.

The Graph visualization is designed to display large amouts of data in your 
browser. Modern browsers can render up to 100.000 datapoints without problems. 
However, to keep rendering smooth on older browsers too, it is better to keep 
the number of datapoints below 10.000. Note that rendering is faster when a 
smaller part of the data is visible, i.e. when zooming in.

The Graph is developed as a Google Visualization Chart in javascript. There is 
a GWT wrapper available to use the Graph in GWT (Google Web Toolkit). It runs 
in all browsers without additional requirements. Graph is tested on Firefox 3.6, 
Safari 5.0, Chrome 6.0, Opera 10.6, Internet Explorer 6 to 9.


USAGE

To use the GWT version of the Graph, create a GWT project. Put a copy of the 
modules gwt-links-graph.jar and gwt-visualization.jar in a subfolder of your 
project (for example lib), and add both jar-modules to your project via 
"Build path", "Configure Build Path...", "Add JARs...". Then, add the following 
lines to the module file YourProject.gwt.xml:

    <!-- Other module inherits                                      -->
    <inherits name='com.google.gwt.visualization.Visualization'/> 
    <inherits name='com.chap.links.Graph'/>

    <!-- External stylesheets                                       -->
    <!-- Include at least one stylesheet, else the stylesheets in   -->
    <!-- external modules like gwt-links-graph.jar are not loaded...-->
    <stylesheet src=""></stylesheet>  

Thats all, now you can use the Graph.
